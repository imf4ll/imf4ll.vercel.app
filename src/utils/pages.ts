  me: `# Welcome to my personal website üòÅ

How can you clearly see, the love of my life is Neovim, so I decided to create a frontend based on this!
Let me introduce myself, my name is Carlos Daniel, I'm a 20 years old fullstack developer, mostly self-
taugh, currently doing my first degree on Univesp (a 100% virtual college of Sao Paulo, Brazil), and of
course, I was born in Brazil and currently live here. My love for technology is very old, my first contact
with this world was when I was only 5 years old, an old computer (and soooo slow), my first contact with
coding was with Visual Basic, when I was 10 years old but unfortunately I couldn't learn 'cause of problems
with learning. In 2020 (year of the apocalypse), I joined ETEC (Escola T√©cnica de S√£o Paulo), but COVID-19
destroyed with my plans, I dropped out of the course, but I decided that was my life project and my journey
began. First I learned Python, then JavaScript, TypeScript and then I decided to study fullstack development
when I faced ReactJS and fell in love, then I studied Backend development, now I'm currently focused in
mobile development with React Native and Flutter.
